        "content": "In this update we are rolling back two features to be like they were last year: Weekly Wagering & Recycling/Sideshop. The amount of weekly battle points available from wagering is now the same as last year. Sithil and Quirt’s reimagined Sideshop has been shut down. Immortals can now be recycled using the same system as last year. For players that have already recycled immortals, the system will automatically back fill your progress on this replaced system and grant you additional immortal treasures as appropriate. Any rewards previously earned through the Sideshop will remain in player inventories, and if you still have gold and wish to continue rolling in the Sideshop, you can use the dota_show_sideshop command. As part of this update we are also removing ticketing requirements for the Gauntlet.",
